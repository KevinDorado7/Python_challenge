Repository for the challenge #3 Python Challenge

This challenge is composed by two parts (PyBank and PyPoll).

PyBank
In the first part, with the use of the file budget_data.csv, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of the file. This were the instructions:
â€¨-The total number of months included in the dataset
-The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
-The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
-The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
-The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
-The final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results

PyPoll
For the second part, with the use of the file election_data.csv, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. This were the instructions:
-The total number of votes cast
-A complete list of candidates who received votes
-The percentage of votes each candidate won
-The total number of votes each candidate won
-The winner of the election based on popular vote
-The final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

To complete the challenge, I submitted two folders, one for each part, each of them contains a resources folder that contains the initial csv.file and a analysis that has the created txt and lastly a python file with the code.

To complete the challenge:
I made use of resources like Office Hours and ChatGPT to fix issues with the code formatting and other operational problems.
